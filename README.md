**This project is no longer being maintained.  Please see
[this issue](https://github.com/jcs/rubywarden/issues/122)
for further information.**

This project is not associated with the
[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
project nor 8bit Solutions LLC.
Do not contact Bitwarden for support with using this backend server
(or at the very least, make it abundantly clear that you are using a 3rd party backend server).

## Rubywarden

A small, self-contained API server written in Ruby and Sinatra to provide a
private backend for the open-source
[Bitwarden apps](https://github.com/bitwarden).

### Data

All data is stored in a local SQLite database.
This means you can easily run the server locally and have your data never
leave your device, or run it on your own web server via Rack and some front-end
HTTP server with TLS to support syncing across multiple devices.
Backing up your data is as easy as copying the `db/production/production.sqlite3`
file somewhere.

All user data in the SQLite database is stored in an encrypted format the
[same way](https://help.bitwarden.com/crypto.html)
it is in the official Bitwarden backend, where the master password is never
known by the server.
For details on the format, consult the
[documentation](https://github.com/jcs/rubywarden/blob/master/API.md).

### API Documentation

This project also contains independent
[documentation for Bitwarden's API](https://github.com/jcs/rubywarden/blob/master/API.md)
written as I work on this server, since there doesn't seem to be any
documentation available other than the
[.NET Bitwarden code](https://github.com/bitwarden/core)
itself.

### Deployment

Automated deployment of Rubywarden is possible with 3rd party support:

- [Ansible playbook](https://github.com/qbit/openbsd-rubywarden) for OpenBSD

### Manual Setup

Run `bundle install` at least once.

In order to create the initial environment, it is recommended to create a new,
unprivileged user on your system dedicated to running Rubywarden such as
with `useradd`.
This documentation will assume a user has been created named `_rubywarden`.

In order to create the initial database and the required tables run:

	mkdir db/production
	sudo chown _rubywarden db/production
	sudo -u _rubywarden env RUBYWARDEN_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:migrate

To run via Rack on port 4567, as user `_rubywarden`:

	sudo -u _rubywarden env RUBYWARDEN_ENV=production bundle exec rackup -p 4567 config.ru

You'll probably want to run it once with signups enabled, to allow yourself
to create an account:

	sudo -u _rubywarden env RUBYWARDEN_ENV=production RUBYWARDEN_ALLOW_SIGNUPS=1 bundle exec rackup -p 4567 config.ru

Once the server is running, the Bitwarden apps (such as the Firefox extension)
can be configured to use your own Bitwarden server before login.
For a local Rack instance, you can point it at `http://127.0.0.1:4567/`.

To run the test suite:

	bundle exec rake test

### Changing URL Paths

By default, Rubywarden is setup to use paths on a single hostname that the
Bitwarden clients will default to so you do not have to specify separate API,
Identity, and Icon URLs.

If you are not deploying Rubywarden on its own hostname or want to alter the
paths for any reason, you can override them with environment variables:

- `RUBYWARDEN_ATTACHMENTS_URL` for the attachments URL - defaults to `/attachments`
- `RUBYWARDEN_BASE_URL` for the API base - defaults to `/api`
- `RUBYWARDEN_IDENTITY_BASE_URL` for the identity API base - defaults to
  `/identity`
- `RUBYWARDEN_ICONS_URL` for the icon URL - defaults to `/icons`

For example, if you had a website `example.com` and wanted to host Rubywarden
on a subdirectory called `/notbitwarden`, you would set the environment
variables in your startup script:

	sudo -u _rubywarden env RUBYWARDEN_ENV=production RUBYWARDEN_BASE_URL=/notbitwarden/api RUBYWARDEN_IDENTITY_BASE_URL=/notbitwarden/identity RUBYWARDEN_ICONS_URL=/notbitwarden/icons RUBYWARDEN_ATTACHMENTS_URL=/notbitwarden/attachments bundle exec rackup -p 4567 config.ru

Then you can configure the Bitwarden clients with a single server URL of
`https://example.com/notbitwarden`.

### Updating

To update your instance of Rubywarden, fetch the latest code:

	cd /path/to/your/rubywarden
	git pull --ff-only

Run any database migrations:

	sudo -u _rubywarden env RUBYWARDEN_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:migrate

Restart your Rubywarden instance (via Rack, Unicorn, or however you have
deployed it).

### Changing Master Password

Changing a user's master password must be done from the command line (as it
requires interacting with the plaintext password, which the web API will never
do).

	sudo -u _rubywarden env RUBYWARDEN_ENV=production bundle exec ruby tools/change_master_password.rb -u you@example.com

### 2-Factor Authentication

The Bitwarden browser extensions and mobile apps support accounts that require
2FA, by prompting you for the current code after successfully logging in.
To activate Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) on your account after you've
signed up in the previous steps, run the `tools/activate_totp.rb` program on
the server:

	sudo -u _rubywarden env RUBYWARDEN_ENV=production bundle exec ruby tools/activate_totp.rb -u you@example.com

You'll be shown a `data:` URL that has a PNG-encoded QR code, which you must
copy and paste into a browser, then scan with your mobile TOTP authenticator
apps (assuming it supports scanning from the camera).
Once scanned, the activation program will ask you to enter the current TOTP
being shown in the app for verification, and then save the TOTP secret to your
account in the SQLite database.
Your `security_stamp` will be reset, forcing a new login on any devices that
are logged into your account.
Those devices will now prompt for a TOTP code upon future logins.

### Migrating From Other Password Managers

This project inclues utilities that will import data exported from other
password managers, convert it to its own data format, and then import it.

#### 1Password

Export everything from 1Password in its "1Password Interchange Format".
It should create a directory with a `data.1pif` file (which is unencrypted, so
be careful with it).
Once you have created your initial user account through Rubywarden, run the
conversion tool with your account e-mail address:

	sudo -u _rubywarden env RUBYWARDEN_ENV=production bundle exec ruby tools/1password_import.rb -f /path/to/data.1pif -u you@example.com

It will prompt you for the master password you already created, and then
convert and import as many items as it can.

This tool operates on the SQLite database directly (not through its REST API)
so you can run it offline.

#### Bitwarden (Official Apps)

Export your bitwarden vault via the web interface or the browser plugin, which
should prompt you to save a `bitwarden_export_<datestamp>.csv` file. Due to
limitations of the exporter, neither cards nor identities will be exported,
and any custom fields will lose their type (text, hidden, or boolean) and be
simply exported as text.

Once you have created your initial user account through Rubywarden, run the
conversion tool with your account e-mail address:

	sudo -u _rubywarden env RUBYWARDEN_ENV=production bundle exec ruby tools/bitwarden_import.rb -f /path/to/data.csv -u you@example.com

It will prompt you for the master password you already created, and then
convert and import as many items as it can.

This tool operates on the SQLite database directly (not through its REST API)
so you can run it offline.

#### Keepass

In order to use the Keepass converter, you will need to install the necessary
dependency, using `bundle install --with keepass`.

There is no need to export your Keepass-database - you can use it as is.

Once you have created your initial user account through Rubywarden, run the
conversion tool with your account e-mail address:

	sudo -u _rubywarden env RUBYWARDEN_ENV=production bundle exec ruby tools/keepass_import.rb -f /path/to/data.kdbx -u you@example.com

If your Keepass-database is secured using a keyfile, you can pass it using the `-k` parameter:

	sudo -u _rubywarden env RUBYWARDEN_ENV=production bundle exec ruby tools/keepass_import.rb -f /path/to/data.kdbx -k /path/to/keyfile.key -u you@example.com

It will prompt you for the master password you already created, and then
convert and import as many items as it can.

This tool operates on the SQLite database directly (not through its REST API)
so you can run it offline.

#### Lastpass

Export everything from LastPass by going to your vault, "More Options",
"Advanced" and then "Export".
It will then export your details in a new browser window in CSV format, copy
and paste this data into a file accessible from your Rubywarden installation.
Unfortunately due to limitations in LastPass export the "extra fields" and
"attachments" data in the LastPass vault will not be converted.

Once you have created your initial user account through Rubywarden, run the
conversion tool with your account e-mail address:

	sudo -u _rubywarden env RUBYWARDEN_ENV=production bundle exec ruby tools/lastpass_import.rb -f /path/to/data.csv -u you@example.com

It will prompt you for the master password you already created, and then
convert and import as many items as it can.

This tool operates on the SQLite database directly (not through its REST API)
so you can run it offline.
